# About
A repository that hosts my personal portfolio.
# Techs used
Html, Css, Scss, Javascript
# Optimizations
I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability, but almost always for design purposes.
# Lessons Learned
One of the most valuable lessons I learned while completing this portfolio project was the importance of understanding precedence in CSS. I also gained experience in implementing functional contact forms, allowing me to receive notifications via email whenever a submission is made.
