            <span class="Title">Old school video games</span>

            <p class="description">Besides coding, I have a few hobbies that I enjoy. Repairing old-school video games is one of them. In particular, I like repairing N64 games. I also like to resurface PS2 games and fix Nintendo stuff. </p>

            <ul class="bullet-points">

                <li>
                    I have repaired quite a few Nintendo consoles and Gameboys. At the moment, I have three Gameboys, three Gamecubes, and three N64 consoles that I repaired and kept. I also modded one of my GameCubes. (I'm not willing to sell them, so don't ask.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes all it takes to fix a Game Boy is a cotton swab and some isopropyl alcohol. It's true; I fixed some by just rubbing the cotton swab on the power switch.
                </li>

                <li>
                    I have had some failures and things I just can't do right now. But I'm not in a hurry to repair them. For example, I bought a Game Boy Micro from a guy for $5. It doesn't turn on. So I need to diagnose it eventually and potentially buy the parts I need. I just don't have the money for it right now.

                    I still own my original N64, PS2 Slim, Wii, and Xbox 360 from when I was still a kid.
                </li>

                <li>
                    I own two CRT TVs. I bought the first one for $50 and the other for $10. FYI, the $10 one came with its original remote. The remote didn't work at first, but I fixed that with, you guessed it, a cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol.
                </li>

                <li>
                    My most recent console purchase was an original Xbox. It came with a bunch of games, controllers, and a remote. It was $35.
